## Symbols

// is_a?(Symbol): test if 

// symbols can be compared
- symbols can have identical object IDs
- symbols can be equal

// to_sym: convert string to sym
- can have spaces between
- can have string interpolation


Strings can be converted to strings, but symbols are not springs. 

Symbols are immutable, but not an immutable strings because string methods are not available. 

You can dynamically create symbols, but that's not a good idea.
