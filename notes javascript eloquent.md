¶ Pure functions, for a start, are the things that were called functions in the mathematics classes that I hope you have been subjected to at some point in your life. Taking the cosine or the absolute value of a number is a pure function of one argument. Addition is a pure function of two arguments.

¶ The defining properties of pure functions are that they always return the same value when given the same arguments, and never have side effects. They take some arguments, return a value based on these arguments, and do not monkey around with anything else.
