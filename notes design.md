Dominance is when an element in a composition is clearly more important than the others, often because it is bigger, or because of other factors such as color. Do you see how there's more dominance in the second composition?

Similarity is when elements in a composition are similar to each other, whether that be in shape, color, or visual qualities such as line quality (weight, or even the "crispness" of lines). There's obviously a lot of similarity in both of the above compositions, but since the first one lacks many other design principles, it is less interesting.

Rhythm ties together with similarity, because rhythm is created by elements that are repeated over and over again, usually creating a sense of direction, which is one of the other design principles.

Texture is a sense of, well – texture – or a sense that if you were to touch a design that it would have a tactile feel. Texture can be that of sandstone, or polished granite, or anything that has a look of a tactile feel. Even blocks of type give a sense of texture, and vary from typeface to typeface.

Direction is a sense of movement within a composition. This ties strongly with similarity and rhythm because when those principles are present, then there's usually a sense of direction. Notice the similarity, rhythm, and direction (the linear arrangement of the dots) in the second composition.

Contrast is the opposite of similarity. To create visual interest (and in turn meet goals of your design, such as differentiating elements), contrast is a really useful device. Notice, for example, that there's a strong contrast in the sizes of elements in the second composition. This of course ties in with dominance, but also imagine if one of the dots were a completely different color, or had a different texture.

Remember proportion? You may have also noticed – after last week's lesson – that there's a stronger sense of proportion in the second composition. This is because the canvas size – and the size relationships between the dots – in the second composition are all based upon the 3:4 ratio. The first composition is on a square canvas, and the size relationships between the dots are arbitrary.
