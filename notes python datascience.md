## Data Science

When you're dealing with a large, large set of numbers, it can be hard to see patterns in them.  I've heard people claim they can detect patterns in large data sets, but I don't believe them.

## Plotting
Before you do any kind of data analysis, plot it so your visual cortex can give you hints of what's going on.

- You can use this to analyze matrices, but also images.
- Manipulate images to see what's going on in images.

## Pandas: Python replacement for R dataframes
Quickly get a bunch of time-stamped rows, put columns together with it and manipulate.

- Get descriptive statistics
- Get SQL-esque inner and outer joins on a key


## Interrogate your data
- What model assumptions created the data?

A far more powerful approach is flexible data modeling.

To understand the process that created your data, think about them in terms of the distributions. (A normal distribution, a Bernoulli distribution - a coin toss, Poisson distribution, etc.)

All inference is about going back and being a detective: What is our distribution? What parameters did it have?

- Method of moments: assigns empirical mean and variance to their theoretical counterparts so we can solve of parameters

- Maximum likelihood: preferred method; calculator probability of your data existing, given our parameters

Look at the data
Find a distribution
Solve for the equation to fit the model

## Interrogate your parameters
- Values you THINK affect your data points
- A model exists to answer question: How predictive is someone's IQ given someone's zip code?
- Linear Regression: Plot relationship between two variables


** BEWARE OF OVERFITTING **

I'm bad at memorizing. So I never became a biology major. I don't memorize. Just use it. It's pointless to memorize them. Look at them, explore what they do.
