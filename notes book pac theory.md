The results which have been described in this article are mainly of a negative character, setting certain bounds to what we can hope to achieve purely by reasoning. These, and some other results of mathematical logic, may be regarded as going some way toward a demonstration, within mathematics itself, of the inadequacy of 'reason' unsupported by common sense."

This passage may be the first occurrence in science of the idea that common sense is somehow superior to reason.

It foreshadows ample computational experience in the years that followed.

While computers are extremely good at reasoning using mathematical logic, they find common sense much more challenging.
