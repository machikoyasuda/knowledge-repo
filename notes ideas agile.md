# Agile: 

Iterative, incremental, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaborative and self-organizing teams --> planning & evolutionary discovery. 

## Principles: 
- pair programming
- working software > static assets
- show a working app, rathe than comps
- continuous collaboration b/w client & creatives
- quickly respond to change

"These days, it's how you start that determines everything."

Why should we care about the process?

"FEWD used to be designing for the business. But it's becoming more about designing THE business."

(If the product IS digital, IS the front-end, then it is the business).

"Instead of servicing an objective, you're building a business."

"You can't do anything without good data mining."

Design is still about problem-solving. 

- Designers -> execution
- Art Directors -> strategy behind execution
- Developers -> working prototype


If design is the HOW
art direction is the WHY
FEWD is the WHAT
BEWD is the FACTORY
and making products digitally is the NORM.
